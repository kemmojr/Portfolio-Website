                <p>This is some mindless babbling to take up space and fill the website. Websites are an interesting form of communication in which various information is stored in a html document which features the basic structure and design of the webpage by making use of the structure created by enclosing things within tags. Once the information is stored in this way the information is then formatted based on the styling rules and instructions featured within a CSS stylesheet which dictates how to display the data. Webpages also feature various processes that operate in the back end that deal with all of the computation and background calculations that are needed to allow the webpage to run. These include, routing, url parsing, retrival of data and information from it's sources, database calls, client server channel communications and much more.</p>
